# template-vite-react

A sane, opinionated template for esm react projects written in typescript and built with vite.

Uses:

- [biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome) for linting and formatting
- [vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) for tests
- [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) for linting commit messages
- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for git hooks

## running

### `pnpm dev`

Runs the project in watch mode.

### `pnpm build`

Builds/transpiles the code to `./build`.

### `pnpm start`

Runs the production simulation of the project.

### `pnpm test`

Runs tests with vitest.

### `pnpm biome-fix`

Runs biome in fix mode (only [safe fixes](https://biomejs.dev/linter/#safe-fixes)) to lint and format the project.

### `pnpm typecheck`

Runs type checking using tsc.

## that tsconfig.json seems very strict and opinionated

Yup.

## vscode

You might want to install the recommended extensions in vscode. Search for **@recommended** in the extensions tab, they'll show up as _"workspace recommendations"_.

If you have been using eslint and prettier and their extensions, you might want to disable eslint entirely and keep prettier as the formatter only for certain types of files.

This is done by the `.vscode/settings.json` file.

A debug configuration for Firefox is also included.
